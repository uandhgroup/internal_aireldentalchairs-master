</section>

Developer support is ideal for users who have in-house developers and are on the “develop” branch, and have active code customizations, integrations or feature extensions specific to their setup. In developer support, Frappe personnel will help your developers in case they need help or in designing a feature or getting it added to the core.

Frappe developers have experience of working with hundreds of instance and all developers are exposed to all the aspects of the product and are full-stack developers.

### Consulting

When you are designing a new feature or integration, Frappe developers can help you determine the best approach and help you in anticipating problems that may arise based on your approach.

If you are making changes that affect the core, it is usually a good idea that they are merged in the official release so that you are safe in case of future upgrades. Working closely with Frappe developers will help you make sure you are developing as per the Contribution Guidelines.
